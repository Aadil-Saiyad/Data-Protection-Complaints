REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROJECT:

- IDE: The IDE used during this project was Visual Studio Code Windows 64bit so the same would be ideal.
	https://code.visualstudio.com/

- Python: The Python version used in development was 3.12.2 64bit for Windows so the same would be ideal.
	https://www.python.org/downloads/

- Pip: Pip is included by default if you use Python 3.4 or later. Otherwise, you can follow the official installation page of pip to install it.
	https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

- Taipy: The preferred method to install Taipy is by using pip. "pip install taipy". If this does not work, I implemented it using "py -m pip install taipy". However there are multiple ways to install using this tutorial depending on setup.
	https://docs.taipy.io/en/release-3.1/installation/

- Scikit learn: Scikit learn is required to implement the MinMaxScaler normalisation for the risks table. This is done using the command "pip install -U scikit-learn". If this does not work, I implemented it using "py -m pip install scikit-learn".
Further information can be found on their webpage.
	https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

- Pandas: Data maipulation and analysis tool within Python used for data cleansing, preperation, and visualisation. This is installed using the command "pip install pandas".
Further information can be found on their webpage.
	https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html 

- Taipy Cloud Account: In order to host the site on the Taipy cloud, a free account must be created which gives you access to host an application on a machine for 6 hours a day. 
- Creating a Machine: Once the account is created, you can set up your machine with the details you desire, however, ensuring the Python version is set to 3.11.
- Adding the Application: Once the machine is ready, you can add the application to it, ensuring that the project is within a ZIP file and the entry point of the file is set to "main.py". Furthermore, the requirements file should be set to "requirements.txt".

Running this application should then successfully host the Data Protection Complaints Dashboard on the Taipy Cloud URL you set for anyone who has the link to use.
